This repository serves as a personal collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) question (Competitive programming) for last minute revision.
All the codes are written in JAVA and are not production ready codes but for just getting the idea of how the questions can be solved.

Its purely made up of Vanilla JS and plain CSS and HTML.\
No mess, clean and sleek. It uses github api's for fetching the codes from the DSA JAVA folder and displaying it in web interface.
